## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Armenian job market** using data collected from two major recruiting platforms:

- **Job.am**
- **Staff.am**

The notebook performs:
- Web scraping
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of key labor market trends
- Machine Learning modeling:
  - **Clustering** (job segmentation)
  - **Classification** (employment type prediction)

The goal is to better understand employment structure, salary distribution, required skills, and overall market characteristics, while also demonstrating end-to-end data science workflow.
